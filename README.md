<h1>&#128151;Party Manager&#128151;</h1>
<p>
  <br>
This is a party manager application made using .Net and C#! <br>
It's able to send, manage, as well as edit party invitations. (:
<br>
<br>
**Still currently under development, changes need to be made for a better user experience. This is the basic framework and it's working.**
